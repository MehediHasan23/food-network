           <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p>Fahrin Zannat Faiza started her journey as a food-blogger when she realized that people in Dhaka were being deprived of honest and unbiased reviews. Since starting her Facebook page, she has received unbelievable support from people around her and is astonished at how other foodies such as herself value her opinion and make decisions based on her opinion. Going forward, Faiza hopes to make better content for her followers. </p>
